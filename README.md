# Piggy Bank #

  A Simple program that will add, track and display the amount of coins stored inside a piggy bank.\
  The program was build using **TDD** frame combined with **Domain Modelling** and **BDD User Stories** (shown below) to derive the class(s) - _in this case singular class_ - and corresponding methods. 

## User stories ##

 1.  As a user,\
     So that I can save money\
     **I can put coins in my piggy bank**

 2.  As a user,\
     So that I know whether there are coins in my piggy bank\
     **I can shake it, and it will “cling” if there is money in it**

 3.   As a user,\
      So I can enjoy my hard earned savings\
      **I can break my piggy bank and get back the number or coins that I had put in**
